# PirateAgent
CS-370 AI model I created to solve a maze. 

I worked on the functionality and constraints of the AI agent. 

I was given the code for the environment and how the score is kept, I had to create the code that would help my Ai agent learn to navigate the maze.

I learned a lot from this course. Specifically that a lot of learning how to do things in Computer Science takes careful experimentation and logging.  
Computer Scientists solve problems, develop software, and have helped innovate breakthroughs in almost all other realms of study through their creations.
I approach a problem with curiosity and find joy in finding solutions to answers I never thought of. 
I have a responsibility to be straight-forward about anyting I build. What data is being collected, what the goal of the software is, and to only create software that is beneficial and does not cause anyone harm.
